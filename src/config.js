  airbnbDescription:
    "Relax by the beach and listen to the crashing waves at our quaint beach house. This is the perfect place to explore the west side of Puerto Rico. The area is known for tranquil vibes and good surf. We have a lot of delicious local food options nearby and there's a break right in front of the house. Rincon, a global surfer destination, is a short 10 minute car ride away. We know the area well and are always in touch to provide recommendations. Come to the conch for a happy dose of paradise :)",
